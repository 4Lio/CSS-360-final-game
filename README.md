# CSS360 Final Project

## Project Summary
Our Team will develop a 3D game. The game will aim to be interactive and simple using sprites, raycasting and a high level language such as python. 
By creating this video game as a team, we will gain valuable experience when it comes to video game development.

## Goals
 - Make a first-person shooter inspired by the classic DOOM game, with wave-based survival elements.
 - Utilize ray casting with Pygame to simulate a 3D visual perspective within a 2D game environment.
 - Allow the player to control a character through a map, and defeat waves of enemy sprites with guns, with the goal of surviving for as long as possible to achieve a high score
