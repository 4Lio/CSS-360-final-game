Places more emphasis on wave survival aspect of the game

## CHANGES:
 - Updated shotgun sound to remove high, piercing frequencies
 - Edited title name
 - Changed map to be more open and arena-like
 - Increased enemies spawned per wave. It is currently double whatever wave number it is
 - Removed enemy hp bar so player can't see them behind walls
 - Increased player speed by 33%
 - Increased player shotgun damage from 10 to 25. Now kills enemies in two hits instead of 5
 - Enemies now have a hit accuracy of 50%
 - Added a red "blood" screen indicator when the player takes damage

## ISSUES (ranked by severity):
- Chance to spawn the player outside the map or in walls
- Enemies spawn way too close to the player and only in the front of the camera, instead of spread around the map
- You can see being unrendered too early at the left and right edges of the game screen
- Sounds are too loud, especially on stacking gunshot sounds from groups of enemies attacking at the same time
- Enemy attack rate is a bit inconsistent when they have line of sight with you
